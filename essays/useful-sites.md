# Sites

## `nn.svg`

[NN-SVG](https://alexlenail.me/NN-SVG/) 

An automatic +10 pts if I see you including a diagram like this in when grading student reports. Elegant, straightforward, and easy to use.

## `diagrams.net`

[diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/)

Flowcharts that actually looks good unlike mermaid. I wish there's an inbetween of this and mermaid where you can write the flowchart in code but it renders like this.

# Tools

## `oh-my-zsh` with `powerlevel10k`

Made my terminal look so much better.
- no more "why can't I connect to the server" with VPN status
- no more "Am I on the right branch?" with git status
- no more "why is IO speed so slow?" with swap usage
- Geniunely makes using the terminal in classroom and coffee shops feel more ***advanced***. 

## BetterDisplay

The brightness control with external displays is the one feature I need. Thinking about getting the Pro subscription for the extra features like turning some of my display off. 

## iStat Menus

Insanely useful for me. Keep me aware of whether my computer is doing things I want it to do or not. 

## Hidden Bar

With iStat Menus my menubars gets bloated. However now that I am unfortunately on those MacBooks with a notch, I am considering switching to bartender for the popped out second bar. I wish there's a open source implementation for this...

## 1Password

I am a self-proclaimed poweruser who frequenty get new devices and wipe old devices. In my work I also need to log on a lot of shared computers. Having 1Password to manage all my password and 2FA is a life saver. It is defineitly worth the price as long as I am still on my student subscrption pricing. 

## KeyCastr

If you've ever worked IT or have to record a video tutorial on how do to certain things on your computer, you would love this. Also just generally useful for teaching and presentations remotely. I've seen a *cooler* version of this on some of the tech youtuber that I watch, but no one mentioned about what it is called yet so I guess I will stick with this for now. 

## Obsidian

How I got to taking notes with MarkDown and LaTeX. Made my Computer Science journey so much easier. The link feature makes it awesome for connecting contents from different classes and subjects.
