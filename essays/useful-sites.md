# Sites

## `nn.svg`

[NN-SVG](https://alexlenail.me/NN-SVG/) 

An automatic +10 pts if I see you including a diagram like this in when grading reports. Elegant, straightforward, and easy to use.

## `diagrams.net`

Flowcharts that actually looks good unlike mermaid. I wish there's an inbetween of this and mermaid where you can write the flowchart in code but it renders like this.

# Tools

## `oh-my-zsh` with `powerlevel10k`

Made my terminal look so much better.
- no more "why can't I connect to the server" with VPN status
- no more "Am I on the right branch?" with git status
- no more "why is IO speed so slow?" with swap usage
- Geniunely makes using the terminal in classroom and coffee shops feel more ***advanced***. 

## BetterDisplay

The brightness control with external displays is the one feature I need. Thinking about getting the Pro subscription for the extra features like turning it off. 

## iStat Menus

## Hidden Bar

## 1Password

## KeyCastr

If you've ever worked IT or have to record a video tutorial on how do to certain things on your computer, you would love this. Also just generally useful for teaching and presentations remotely. 

## Obsidian

How I got to taking notes with MarkDown and LaTeX. Made my Computer Science journey so much easier. The link feature makes it awesome for connecting contents from different classes and subjects.
