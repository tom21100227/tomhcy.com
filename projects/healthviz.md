summary: "A health data visualization app developed for iOS widgets written completely in Swift/SwiftUI. Privacy sensitive and uses HealthKit to fetch health data."
---

HealthViz is a iOS app designed to provide glancable health metrics from Apple's HealthKit via interactive widgets. It allows user to view their health data in a informative and visually appealing way without needing to open the app. The app is built completely using SwiftUI and leverages the power of HealthKit to fetch and display health data in the most efficient way possible while being privacy-conscious.

It is currently in development and can be tried on iOS 17.0+ devices. This app can be tried on [TestFlight today](https://testflight.apple.com/join/qQNE1ehH).

> TODO: Add screenshots and perhaps a horizontal scrollable section to showcase the app's features.
