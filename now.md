This page is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and it's what I'm focused on at this point in my life.

## Location

I'm currently in La Jolla, California for my job at Salk Institute as a research assistant. 

## Work

I'm currently working on the phenotyping team in Talmo Lab. Some MLOps (as in I sit there while the MLs operate themselves) and some working with mice. My main project involved a longitudinal study for pathogenesis of ALS using SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice. 

## Learning

Currently I am trying to learn more about:

- Web development: This website has been super fun to build and learn from. I'm probably going to learn Svelte next because it seems like a cool frame to use, perhaps I will build a database for it. 
- LangChain: I need to prepare for the day AI replace me! Built a RAG ChatBot for my work as a hobbyist project. 
- iOS Development: Trying to build my first iOS app [HealthViz](/projects/healthviz). This has been going slow...
- Prefect: A orchestrator that I've been using for work. It seems like it is super powerful and I want to be a master at it. Recently just became a contributor for it! 

## Reading

I'm currently reading [Honeybee Democracy](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=honeybee+democracy). Recommended by my professor Jack O'Brien.

Next on the list: 

Fluent Python by Luciano Ramalho. I want to learn more about how to write pythonic code. Recommended by Patrick. 

## Thinking about

Can you actually make a profit from online betting platforms like Kalshi?
