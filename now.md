This page is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), you should consider adding one if you have a website as well.

## Location

I'm currently in La Jolla, California for my job at Salk Institute as a research assistant.

## Life

There's room for improvement for the San Diego leg of my life for sure. But at least the weather is nice so I could ride my bike every once in a while if I am not bed rotting.

## Work

I'm currently working on the phenotyping team in Talmo Lab. Some MLOps (as in I sit there while the MLs operate themselves) and some working with mice. My main project involved a longitudinal study for pathogenesis of ALS using SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice. It's been fulfilling and busy!

## Learning

Currently I am trying to learn more about:

- Prefect: A orchestrator that I've been using for work. It seems like it is super powerful and I want to be a master at it. Recently just became a contributor for it!
- LangChain: I need to prepare for the day AI replace me! Built a RAG ChatBot for my work as a hobbyist project.
- Web development: This website has been super fun to build and learn from. Currently I am making a Svelte project with [tomtopia](https://tomtopia.com), I wonder what is inside...
- iOS Development: Trying to build my first iOS app [HealthViz](/projects/healthviz). Just released an v0.1, but trying to add some AI into this! 

## Reading

I'm currently reading [Honeybee Democracy](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=honeybee+democracy). Recommended by my professor Jack O'Brien.

Next on the list:

Fluent Python by Luciano Ramalho. I want to learn more about how to write pythonic code. Recommended by Patrick.

## Thinking about

If Anthropic uses Claude Code to write Claude Code can you say that Claude Code use Claude to Code Claude Code?
