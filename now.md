This page is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and it's what I'm focused on at this point in my life.

## Location

I'm currently in La Jolla, California for my new job at Salk Institute.

## Work

I'm currently working on the phenotyping team in Talmo Lab.

## Learning

Currently I am trying to learn more about:

- Web development: This website has been super fun to build and learn from.
- iOS Development: Trying to build my first iOS app [HealthViz](/projects/healthviz)

## Reading

I'm currently reading [Honeybee Democracy](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=honeybee+democracy). Recommended by my professor Jack O'Brien.

## Thinking about

What can I do with a self hosted server?
