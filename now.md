This page is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and it's what I'm focused on at this point in my life.

## Location

I'm currently in La Jolla, California for my job at Salk Institute as a research assistant.

## Work

I'm currently working on the phenotyping team in Talmo Lab. Some MLOps (as in I sit there while the MLs operate themselves) and some emails sending. This week (Aug 18) I am participating in the Sleap-NN hackathon to help improve our next release of SLEAP, now powered by PyTorch. 

## Learning

Currently I am trying to learn more about:

- Web development: This website has been super fun to build and learn from.
- LangChain: I need to prepare for the day AI replace me! Built a RAG ChatBot for my work as a hobbyist project. 
- iOS Development: Trying to build my first iOS app [HealthViz](/projects/healthviz). This has been going slow...

## Reading

I'm currently reading [Honeybee Democracy](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=honeybee+democracy). Recommended by my professor Jack O'Brien.

## Thinking about

What can I do with a self hosted server?
