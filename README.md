TODO:

- Add a filter for projects to filter by (programming) language.
- Add a Chinese (Simplified) Version, and the corresponding language toggle.
- AI Summary For Projects (cuz everyone loves that)
- Profile Icons with the latest project that I am working on. 
- Make my cool adaptive badge/pill system more generic so that I can use it for other things.
