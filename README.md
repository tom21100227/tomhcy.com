# Professional Portfolio

Based on [TechFolios](https://techfolios.github.io), this professional portfolio showcases my skills and projects.

Changes made from the original TechFolios template include:

- **Features**
    - [Animation effects for icons around profile picture](https://tomhcy.com/essays/for-this-site.html#profile-picture-animation)
    - [Implemented dark mode](https://tomhcy.com/essays/for-this-site.html#dark-mode)
    - Added a "Now Playing" Indicator with [Now Playing API](https://github.com/tom21100227/now-playing-api)
    - Clicking my name would cycle through different versions of my name.
- **Aesthetics**
    - Layout changes to the home page (bio section under the profile picture)
    - [Added "Last Updated" field to writings/essays that receives updates.](https://tomhcy.com/essays/for-this-site.html#last-updated-for-writings)
    - [Refine the project page logic to include years long project and sort accordingly](https://tomhcy.com/essays/for-this-site.html#project-page-logic)
    - Reworked card layout to adapt for mobile interface and support non-square images.
- **Miscellaneous**
    - Added a "Last Updated" badge to the footer to indicate when the site was last updated.

TODO:

- Maybe change writing to something else
- Visitor counter (distinct visitors and page views I guess)
- Badges/Pills that represents a coding language should change color based on the language and have a little icon along with it. 
  - Once that's done, I can add a filtering system to filter by language.
