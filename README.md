# Professional Portfolio

Based on [TechFolios](https://techfolios.github.io), this professional portfolio showcases my skills and projects.

Changes made from the original TechFolios template include:

- Animation effects for icons around profile picture
- Layout changes to the home page
- Implemented dark mode
- Refine the project page logic to include years long project and sort accordingly
- Added a "Last Updated" date to writings/essays that are more of a blog. 
- Added a "Now Playing" feature with [Now Playing API](https://github.com/tom21100227/now-playing-api)
- Reworked card layout to adapt for mobile interface and support non-square images.
- Added a "Last Updated" badge to the footer

TODO:

- Maybe change writing to something else
- Visitor counter (distinct visitors and page views I guess)
